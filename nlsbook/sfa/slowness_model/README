Matlab source code for the temporal slowness model of complex cells
*******************************************************************

This directory contains a user-friendly version of the Matlab source
code of the model of self-organization of receptive fields based on
temporal slowness described in
 Berkes, P. and Wiskott, L. (2003). Slow feature analysis yields a
rich repertoire of complex-cell properties. Cognitive Sciences EPrint
Archive (CogPrint) 2804.

Download
--------

The newest version of this package can be found at
http://itb.biologie.hu-berlin.de/~berkes/software/slowness_model/

Prerequisites
-------------

To use the Matlab code you need the sfa-tk v.1.0.1 library, available
at http://itb.biologie.hu-berlin.de/~berkes/software/sfa-tk/sfa-tk.shtml .

Installation
------------

To install this package, simply unpack the archive into your favorite
Matlab directory. This is going to create a 'slowness_model'
directory. Before you begin to use the functions, make sure that the
'sfa_tk/sfa' and the 'sfa_tk/lcov' directories of the sfa-tk library
are in your Matlab path.

Quick start
-----------

The script start.m runs a simulation with default settings and
displays the optimal stimuli of the resulting functions. You might
want to edit it in order to change some of the parameters.
