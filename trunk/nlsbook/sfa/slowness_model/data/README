This directory contains five frames of a video sequence recorded by
Tobias Blaschke, Pietro Berkes, and Tiziano Zito at the Berlin zoo.
They contain five different animals in a natural environment.
Although our model does learn complex cells when applied to image
sequences created from these five images, it is not recommended to use
them to make simulations for scientific publications.

A large database of natural images mantained by Hans van Hateren is
available at http://hlab.phys.rug.nl/archive.html . Images from this
database have been used in our simulations and in other
publications. For a description of the database see

  cells in primary visual cortex.

Another set of natural images has been made available by the ICA group
at the Helsinki University of Technology at
